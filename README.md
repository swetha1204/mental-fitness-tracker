## SUMMARY
- Developed a fully functional Mental Health Fitness Tracker ML model using Python and scikit-learn.
- Utilized 12 types of regression algorithms to achieve precise results in analyzing and predicting mental fitness levels from over 150 countries.
- Cleaned, preprocessed, and engineered features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
- Optimized the model's performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters and implementing ensemble methods, resulting in an impressive accuracy percentage of 98.50%.
